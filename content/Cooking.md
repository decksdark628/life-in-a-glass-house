Welcome! Here I'll post pics of whatever I cook that I happen to photograph. I may include descriptions or other information. I may also never update this again. Who knows ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Anyway, here's some stuff I've made
## 2024
### ~~Chocolate cake~~ Brownies with crema pastelera
Originally a [heavy-pan cake recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru2NffZ9WRU) that [didn't go as expected](https://i.imgur.com/kzeTkAP.jpeg). Tried to salvage it by cutting it into small bites.
- **Ingredients:** Flour, butter, sugar, colacao, a dash of milk, crema pastelera.
- **Taste:** Good, very chocolaty

### Onigiris
Originally an improvised snack for a beach trip.
- **Ingredients:** sushi rice, nori seaweed, canned tuna, green olives, red pepper, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard.
- **Taste:** It was very tasty

The picture displayed here is from a second attempt using a mix of fried chicken and pork with quinoa

A third attempt using chocolate-flavored quinoa was conducted later. It was good 
### Makis
- **Ingredients:** sushi rice, nori seaweed, carrots, avocado, beef 
- **Taste:** Good. I would have added a tiny bit more salt to the meat in hindsight, but tasty nonetheless.

### Vegan hamburger
- **Ingredients** Tofu, onions, garlic, carrots, chickpeas, saltine crackers, spices
- **Taste:** Not like a hamburger, but nice
- **Texture:** Like an unnaturally soft and floury hamburger.

### Gyozas
The [ideal wrapper should be round instead of square](https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fill-and-Fold-Gyoza.jpg), but for the sake of convenience I just bought some wonton wrappers from the supermarket, wrapped it however I could and called it a day.

- **Ingredients of the filling:** Tofu, carrots, green onion, garlic, ginger, soy sauce and corn starch
##### Test 1
On my first attempt I just cooked everything in the air fryer. [Some parts got stuck to the cooking surface](https://i.imgur.com/ViT8Zxg.jpg), but overall the result was good.

- **Taste:** Nice
- **Texture:** Very crunchy and a little dry
!!! warning Warning
	 Never make them pointy on the top if you're supposed to bite on them. It's hurts your palate.

##### Test 2
For my second attempt I decided to steam them. I also took away the sharp point on top.

I made two variants:
1. First steamed and later air-fried _on the right side_
2. Completely steamed _on the left side_ (I personally liked these ones more)

Since I was happy with the chewy steamed gyozas, that was the end of my experiments for now, but I plan to revisit them someday. Probably making my own dumpling dough next time.

### Fried tofu
Cut into slices and then fried on a pan. Seasoned with salt, pepper and cumin. It barely counts as cooking
- **Taste:** Good
- **Texture:** Kind of between cheese and a fluffy omelette

### Banana oatmeal pancakes

### Beans with chicken and rice
The chicken was marinate in some sort of honey and soy sauce mix, but I can't remember what it was. The beans include yellow corn
